Privacy Policy for SmartTab Saver
Last Updated: September 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how SmartTab Saver ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our Chrome extension.

Information We Access
SmartTab Saver is designed with your privacy in mind. To provide its core functionality, the extension needs to access the following on your local browser:

Web History and Tab Information: The extension accesses the URLs and titles of your open tabs. This is necessary to identify inactive tabs for suspension, manage them (suspend, restore), and check them against your user-defined whitelist. This information is processed entirely locally on your device and is not stored, transmitted, or sold.
Website Content: The extension accesses the favicon (icon) of a webpage before suspending it. This icon is displayed on the suspended tab page to help you visually identify your tabs. The extension does not read, store, or transmit any other content from the websites you visit.
User Settings: All your settings, such as the suspension timer and the whitelist, are stored locally on your computer using the standard Chrome Storage API.
Data Storage and Transmission
All data and information accessed by SmartTab Saver are processed and stored locally on your device. We do not have any servers, and we do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data or browsing activity to any third party.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
